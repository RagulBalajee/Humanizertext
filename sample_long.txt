🧠 AI-Powered Content Humanizer
📌 Project Overview

The AI Content Humanizer is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based project designed to automatically rewrite machine-generated or repetitive text into a more natural, human-like format.
It uses WordNet synonyms, sentence restructuring, and random variations to generate multiple humanized versions of a given paragraph.

This tool is useful for:

Content creators who need fresh variations of text.

Students and professionals who want simplified or restructured content.

Reducing AI-detection similarity by making text sound less robotic.

⚙️ How It Works

Input Paragraph – The user provides a block of text.

Sentence Tokenization – Text is split into sentences for fine-grained editing.

Word-Level Humanization –

Random words are replaced with synonyms from WordNet.

Variability ensures that every run generates different outputs.

Sentence Restructuring – Sentences are shuffled slightly to mimic human rephrasing.

Output Generation – Multiple unique versions of the original paragraph are produced.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – Tokenization, synonym generation via WordNet

Randomization – To introduce natural variations in words and sentence order

🚀 Features

Generates multiple humanized versions of the same text.

Ensures semantic meaning is preserved while structure and wording change.

Can be extended with similarity checking (Cosine/Jaccard) to measure how unique each version is.

Lightweight and runs locally without external APIs.

📊 Example

Original Paragraph:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries across the globe. 
It powers applications ranging from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous vehicles. 
Businesses are leveraging AI to enhance productivity and decision-making processes.


Humanized Version (Sample):

AI is reshaping industries worldwide. From self-driving cars to medical diagnostics, 
its impact is everywhere. Many companies are adopting AI to boost efficiency 
and improve strategic choices.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Integrate AI similarity metrics to avoid near-duplicate outputs.

Add grammar correction with LanguageTool or spaCy.

Use transformer models (GPT, BERT, Pegasus) for more advanced rephrasing.

Build a web UI so users can paste text and download humanized versions.
